     </div>
     <div class="col-lg-8">
 <p style="color:white;">We decided to establish a web app for RMG industries.Our motive is learning about an very
     effective and efficient technology of Courier service of different samples for ready made garments
     factories in Bangladesh.We proposed this technique to add some value for ready made garments factory
     where sample transaction occurs in a daily basis as RMG is the  biggest revenue earning industry in our
     country.We choose to develop the delivery of samples because of sampling is the 1st key element to
     get bulk order.Though sample delivery is must here, it follows a traditional and poor intra sample
     delivery system between factories and buying offices.So our technique can bring some possible solutions
     to overcome these problem.Buyers & sellers can track their samples anytime from anywhere which will reduce
     mental stress & improve the transparency of products.There will be no needed of excessive people & costs for
     factories to handle samples delivery.Factories can get total buyer wise samples sending data,costs &
     whatâ€™s return for better decision making.Sample can be sent anytime,no need stick to one or two times
     which will safe time.So saving time,reducing stresses and give transparency are prime concern of our system .
     We decided to work with this according to demand of time in ready made garments factory in Bangladesh.
     In our project,the whole system deals with giving the service to customers(i.e  merchandisers,buying
     house officers) and response to a delivery request of registered drivers.We have more plans of some features
     to implement further.We will try with our best effort to
     make this technique as reliable as possible and also put sincerity to make sense of our system.</p>
